# Abstract

Background: 
Epidemiological studies show that subjects with elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] have a higher risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. 
Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is one of the limited options to reduce Lp(a). 
In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab on lipoprotein metabolism in subjects with elevated Lp(a).

Methods:
We performed metabolic profiling of plasma samples derived from 30 individuals (placebo N = 14; evolocumab N = 16). 
By applying Bayesian lognormal regression, we assessed the effects of evolocumab treatment on circulating Lp(a) as well as 14 lipoprotein subclasses. 
Our further regression analysis revealed the distribution of LDL particles with and without apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] before and after evolocumab treatment.

Results:
We identified that evolocumab treatment for 16 weeks resulted in 18.9% reduction of circulating Lp(a), coupled with substantial reduction of VLDL, IDL and LDL particles. 
Moreover, we identified that evolocumab treatment not only reduced LDL particle concentrations, but also the distributions between LDL particles with and without apo(a). 

Conclusions:
Based on our analysis, we suggest that the LDL particles with and without apo(a) tail may have different affinity for binding to the LDL receptor. 
Evolocumab-induced reduction of LDL particles may mainly correspond to the reduction of LDL particles without apo(a).

# Introduction

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and often considered as a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle with an apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] tail produced by *LPA*. 
Unlike LDL-cholesterol lowering, limited therapeutic options are available to reduce plasma Lp(a) concentration. 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibody such as evolocumab has been shown to lower Lp(a) [@Raal2014; @Watts2017; @Shapiro2019].
PCSK9 binds to hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and mediates their degradation in lysosome.
Evolocumab (also called AMG 145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets PCSK9 and prevents it from binding to the LDL receptor. 
Although evolocumab-induced Lp(a) reduction was linked to enhanced LDL receptor mediated uptake and attenuated Lp(a) production, the mechanism of Lp(a) lowering by PCSK9 inhibition is unknown [@Romagnuolo2015; @Raal2016; @Watts2018]. 
As shown in a recent meta-analysis, useage of statins leads to increasing of Lp(a) concentration [@Tsimikas2019]. 
More interestingly, decreasing Lp(a) concentration was seen in homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) patients after treatment of evolocumab [@Raal2015]. 
These observations suggested existence of non-LDL receptor mediated catabolism of Lp(a). 
In the current study, we aim to explore the alternative pathways beyond LDL receptor-mediated catabolism of Lp(a).
To this end, we studied the metabolic effects of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab in 30 subjects (placebo 14; evolocumab 16) with elevated Lp(a). 
We identified that despite evolocumab treatment for 16 weeks resulted in 18.9% reduction of Lp(a), coupled with substantial reduction of VLDL, IDL and LDL particles.   
Our further analysis revealed that evolocumab treatment not only reduced LDL particle concentrations, but also changed the distribution between LDL particles with and without apo(a). 

# Methods

## Study design

This was a site-specific sub study of the ANITSCHKOW trial (NCT02729025) conducted at the Amsterdam UMC in The Netherlands between April 2016 and July 2017. 
The ANITSCHKOW trial was a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using subcutaneous injections of evolocumab 420mg Q4W for 16 weeks as investigational product [@Stiekema2018].
The study was conducted in accordance to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol was approved by the ethic committee of the Amsterdam UMC. 

Patients were found to be eligible for enrollment in the ANITSCHKOW trial when they were $\geq$ 50 years of age, had a fasting LDL-C of $\geq$ 2.6 mmol/L (100mg/dL), and an Lp(a) of $\geq$ 125nmol/L (50mg/dL). 
At time of randomization, study subjects who were on lipid lowering treatment had to be on a stable dosing regimen for at least 8 weeks. 
Exclusion criteria were among others, diabetes mellitus and a cardiovascular event within three months prior to randomization. 
The complete list of eligibility criteria was reported previously [@Stiekema2018].

## Biochemical measurements

Blood samples were obtained at time of randomization and sixteen weeks after treatment. 
Patients were fasting for $\geq$ 9 hours for both blood withdrawals. 
Lipoprotein(a) levels were measured using an isoform-independent immunoturbidometric assay (Polymedco, Cortlandt Manor, NY, USA) and reported in nmol/L. 

## Metabolite quantification

Quantification of 14 lipoproteins was performed by using a high-throughput NMR metabolomics platform (Nightingale, Austria)
The following 14 lipoprotein subclasses were quantified: 
extremely large (average particle diameter >75 nm), 
very large (average particle diameter 64.0 nm), large (53.6 nm), medium (44.5 nm), small (36.8 nm) and very small VLDL (31.3 nm); 
intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL; 28.6 nm); 
three LDL subclasses, i.e. large (25.5 nm), medium (23.0 nm) and small LDL (18.7 nm); 
and four HDL subclasses, i.e. very large (14.3 nm), large (12.1 nm), medium (10.9 nm) and small HDL (8.7 nm).

## Statistical analysis

### Effects of evolocumab on Lp(a) and lipoprotein particles

The outcome variable ($y$) was concentration of Lp(a) or one of the 14 lipoprotein subclasses. 
Two predictor variables were used: 1) evolocumab treatment (evolocumab, $T_i$ = 1; placebo $T_i = 0$); 2) baseline Lp(a) or lipoprotein particle concentration ($x$).
The baseline concentrations were centered and scaled so that the mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1.

To assess metabolic effects of evolocumab treatment, we ran lognormal regression analysis. 
The lognormal distribution was chosen to model the outcome variable because its values were positive continuous. 
Due to missing observations in outcome variables, we applied the Bayesian approach to handle the missing data. 
There are two types of missing values, which are as follows: 
(1) when the concentration of a metabolite is below the limit of detection, 
or (2) when values were rejected by the automatic sample and measurement quality control procedure in the Nightingale pipeline. 
All the missing observations were assumed missing at random and treated as parameters.
Values were randomly drawn from a lognormal distribution. 
Regarding the missing values that were below the limit of detection, the imputed values were constrained between zero and the minimal observed value. 
We fitted the model by running Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo in the program Stan (version 2.18.3).
We ran four Markov chains with 2000 iterations in each chain. 
Results were presented with the posterior mean of lognormal regression coefficient with 95% credible interval (CI). 
The lognormal regression coefficient can be interpreted as the expected proportional change in the metabolite concentration.

### Effects of evolocumab on composition of LDL particles

Because Lp(a) is often considered to comprise a LDL particle and covalently bound apo(a), we assumed that a pool of LDL particles is comprised by LDL particles with and without apo(a). 
In the Nightingale platform, three kinds of LDL particles (large, medium and small VLDL) were profiled. 
To identify the proportion of particles with apo(a) in each of these three pools, we ran Bayesian regression analysis. 
The outcome variable ($y$) was concentration of Lp(a). 
Three predictor variables were used: 1) Large LDL particle concentration $x_1$; 2) Medium LDL particle concentration ($x_2$); 3) Small LDL particle concentration ($x_3$). 
We excluded the intercept from our regression model and used the beta distribution $Beta(1,1)$ as the prior distribution for the regression coefficients. 
Because of the same motivation dealing with missing data, we applied the Bayesian approach. 
As mentioned above, we fitted the model by running four Markov chains with 2000 iterations in each chain. 
The regression coefficients are interpreted as proportion of LDL particles with apo(a) tail. 

# Results

The current study included 30 patients (evolocumab, n = 16; placebo, n = 14). 
Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable and provided in Table 1. 

## Effects on lipoprotein particles

Evolocumab treatment for 16 weeks resulted in mean 18.9% (95% credible interval: 7.51% to 29.2%) reduction in Lp(a) compared with placebo (Figure 1).

To identify the corresponding effects of evolocumab on lipoprotein metabolism, we focused on the 14 lipoprotein subclasses. 
We observed that evolocumab treatment resulted in substantial reduction in particle concentration of extremely large (-2.09 [-4.25 -0.284]), very large (-2.87 [-5.53 -0.488]), large (-0.973 [-1.69, -0.350]), medium (-0.702 [-0.979, -0.413]), small (-0.492 [-0.610 -0.367]) and very small VLDL (-0.640 [-0.770 -0.515]) compared with placebo.
We also observed that compared with placebo evolocumab treatment resulted in particle concentration reduction in IDL (-0.765 [-0.930, -0.587]), large (-0.842 [-1.05 -0.657]), medium (-0.901 [-1.12, -0.698]) and small LDL (-0.810 [-1.00, -0.610]). 
In contrast to VLDL and LDL particles, we observed that evolocumab treatment resulted in increasing concentrations of medium HDL particle (0.119 [0.0366, 0.200]) (Figure 2).

## Effects on LDL particle compositions

Lp(a) is thought to be comprised of a LDL particle and a covalently bound apo(a). 
In the Nightingale metabolomics platform, three LDL particles, including large, medium and small LDL, were profiled. 
At baseline, we identified that on average 43.9% (95% credible interval [0.0102%, 89.3%]) large LDL, 40.9% ([0.00807%, 88.6%]) medium LDL particles and 50.5% ([5.39% 97.3%]) small LDL particles were with apo(a) (Figure 3). 
The correlations of LDL-apo(a) proportion between these three LDL particles were -0.4 (large and medium LDL), -0.62 (large and small LDL) and -0.42 (medium and small LDL).

After treatment of evolocumab, on average 76.5% (41.5%, 100%) large LDL particles were with apo(a). 
In the pool of medium LDL particles, on average 69.2% (25.5%, 100%) of them were with apo(a). 
Regarding small LDL particles, on average 75.8% (39.3%, 100%) of them were with apo(a).

# Discussion

In the current study, evolocumab treatment for 16 weeks resulted in on average 18.9% reduction in Lp(a) compared with placebo.
Our detailed lipoprotein profiling revealed that treatment of evolocumab substantially reduced concentrations of VLDL, IDL and LDL particles. 
Our observation is consistent with the previous study, in which evolocumab treatment not only reduced concentrations of LDL particles, but also substantially reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles [@Toth2018].
The next question we came up with is "why we observed large effect of evolocumab on VLDL, IDL and LDL particle concentrations but relatively small effect on Lp(a)?" 
To address the question, we analyzed the composition of LDL particles. 
Because Lp(a) is often thought to be comprised of a LDL particle and a covalently bound apo(a), we assumed that a pool of LDL particles contained LDL particles with and without apo(a) tail. 
At baseline, we identified that on average 40%-50% of large, medium and small LDL particles had apo(a) tail. 
After evolocumab treatment, we identified that the proportion of LDL with apo(a) in all three pools of LDL particles increased to about 70%-75%. 
The composition shifting to relatively more LDL particles with apo(a) indicated that the reduction of LDL particles may mainly correspond to the reduction of LDL particles without apo(a). 
Indeed Lp(a) needs to compete with LDL particles for binding to the LDL receptor, and is preferred for uptake by the LDL receptor when the LDL particle concentration is low [@Raal2016].  
We hypothesized that the LDL particles with and without apo(a) tail may have different affinity for binding to the LDL receptor. 
Besides LDL receptor, we acknowledge that VLDL receptor can also mediate Lp(a) catabolism [@Argraves1997]. 
In our analysis, we observed substantial reduction in VLDL particle concentrations after treatment of evolocumab. 
Since PCSK9 can induce the degradation of LDL receptor as well as VLDL receptor, evolocumab treatment must enhance activity of both receptors [@Poirier2008]. 
Interestingly, we observed that most of patients receiving evolocumab ended in very low concentration (below the detection limit) of extremely large and very large VLDL particles, suggesting enhancement of VLDL receptor activity. 

## Strengths and limitations

Strengths and limitations of our study warrant consideration. 
Our study provided first insight into relationship between Lp(a) concentrations and NMR LDL particle concentrations. 
One limitation of our study is that due to small sample size, our uncertainty of LDL particle composition estimation is large.
