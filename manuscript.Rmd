# Abstract

Background: 
Epidemiological studies show that subjects with elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] have a higher risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. 
Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is one of the limited options to reduce Lp(a). 
In this study, we aimed to investigate metabolic effects of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab in subjects with elevated Lp(a).

Methods:
We performed metabolic profiling of plasma samples derived from 30 individuals (placebo N = 14; evolocumab N = 16). 
By applying Bayesian lognormal regression, we assessed the effects of evolocumab treatment on circulating metabolites such as lipoproteins and amino acids. 
Further hierarchical modeling, we also studied effects of evolocumab treatment on proportions of LDL particles with and without apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. 

Results:
We identified that evolocumab treatment for 16 weeks resulted in 18.9% reduction of circulating Lp(a), coupled with substantial reduction of VLDL, IDL and LDL particles. 
Moreover, we observed that evolocumab treatment tended to increase the proportion of LDL particles with apo(a). 

Conclusions:
Based on our analysis, we showed that evolocumab treatment had large effects on lipoprotein metabolism.

# Introduction

lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], synthesized in liver, is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle with an apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] tail. 
Similar to other lipoproteins, Lp(a) is cleared from the circulation primarily by the liver [@Cain2005]. 
Epidemiological studies showed that subjects with elevated Lp(a) had increasing risk of developing cardiovascular disease [@ODonoghue2019]. 
Unlike LDL-cholesterol lowering, limited therapeutic options are available to reduce plasma Lp(a) concentration [@VanCapelleveen2016]. 
One of the agents that are capable to lower circulating Lp(a) levels is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibody, which prevents extracellular PCSK9 from binding to the LDL receptor, and results in supraphysiological abundance of LDL receptors [@Raal2014; @Raal2016].
The excess number of LDL receptors on the surface of hepatocytes were hypothesized to be responsible for the enhanced Lp(a) catabolism [@Romagnuolo2015; @Raal2016]. 
However, the above hypothesis does not concur with the effect of statins therapy, which significantly increases hepatic LDL receptor abundances but also increases plasma Lp(a) levels [@Tsimikas2019]. 
The same hypothesis was also challenged by the observation that LDL receptor knock out mice had similar Lp(a) catabolism as the wild type mice [@Cain2005]. 
Therefore, what roles LDL-receptor plays in Lp(a) catabolism has not been elucidated and remains a matter of debate [@Reyes-Soffer2017; @Watts2018; @Stoekenbroek2018]. 
In addition to the LDL receptor, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) were also found to act as potential receptor for Lp(a), indicating more than one pathway is likely to be involved in Lp(a) reduction by PCKS9 inhibition [@Argraves1997; @Yang2013].
As a cost-effective approach, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics simultaneously quantifies hundreds of circulating biomarkers and provides insights on multiple pathways [@Soininen2009].
In fact, NMR metabolomics has been used to study metabolic effects that were associated with  *LPA* loci, as well as genetic inhibition of PCSK9 [@Kettunen2016; @Sliz2018]. 
However, genetic inhibition of PCSK9 is different from inhibition with monoclonal antibody, and there is lack of studies on metabolic effects of PCSK9 inhibition with monoclonal antibody. 
In the current study, we aim to study metabolic changes corresponding to Lp(a) reduction in subjects with elevated Lp(a) after treatment of PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (evolocumab).
To this end, we performed NMR metabolomics of plasma samples derived from 30 healthy participants with elevated Lp(a) levels (placebo 14; evolocumab 16). 
Since Lp(a) and LDL significantly overlap in density, protein and lipid composition, LDL measurements made by current technologies contain the content of Lp(a) [@Yeang2015]. 
To address this issue, in this study we developed a statistical model to distinguish these two lipoproteins. 

# Methods

## Study design

This was a site-specific sub study of the ANITSCHKOW trial (NCT02729025) conducted at the Amsterdam UMC in The Netherlands between April 2016 and July 2017. 
The ANITSCHKOW trial was a phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using subcutaneous injections of evolocumab 420mg Q4W for 16 weeks as investigational product [@Stiekema2018].
The study was conducted in accordance to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol was approved by the ethic committee of the Amsterdam UMC. 

Patients were found to be eligible for enrollment in the ANITSCHKOW trial when they were $\geq$ 50 years of age, had a fasting LDL-C of $\geq$ 2.6 mmol/L (100mg/dL), and an Lp(a) of $\geq$ 125nmol/L (50mg/dL). 
At time of randomization, study subjects who were on lipid lowering treatment had to be on a stable dosing regimen for at least 8 weeks. 
Exclusion criteria were among others, diabetes mellitus and a cardiovascular event within three months prior to randomization. 
The complete list of eligibility criteria was reported previously [@Stiekema2018].

## Biochemical measurements

Blood samples were obtained at time of randomization and sixteen weeks after treatment. 
Patients were fasting for $\geq$ 9 hours for both blood withdrawals. 
Lipoprotein(a) levels were measured using an isoform-independent immunoturbidometric assay (Polymedco, Cortlandt Manor, NY, USA) and reported in nmol/L. 

## Metabolite quantification

Quantification of 14 lipoproteins was performed by using a high-throughput NMR metabolomics platform (Nightingale, Austria)
The following 14 lipoprotein subclasses were quantified: 
extremely large (average particle diameter >75 nm), 
very large (average particle diameter 64.0 nm), large (53.6 nm), medium (44.5 nm), small (36.8 nm) and very small VLDL (31.3 nm); 
intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL; 28.6 nm); 
three LDL subclasses, i.e. large (25.5 nm), medium (23.0 nm) and small LDL (18.7 nm); 
and four HDL subclasses, i.e. very large (14.3 nm), large (12.1 nm), medium (10.9 nm) and small HDL (8.7 nm).

## Statistical analysis

### Effects of evolocumab on Lp(a) and lipoprotein particles

The outcome variable ($y$) was concentration of Lp(a) or one of the 14 lipoprotein subclasses. 
Two predictor variables were used: 1) evolocumab treatment (evolocumab, $T_i$ = 1; placebo $T_i = 0$); 2) baseline Lp(a) or lipoprotein particle concentration ($x$).
The baseline concentrations were centered and scaled so that the mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1.

To assess metabolic effects of evolocumab treatment, we ran lognormal regression analysis. 
The lognormal distribution was chosen to model the outcome variable because its values were positive continuous. 
Due to missing observations in outcome variables, we applied the Bayesian approach to handle the missing data. 
There are two types of missing values, which are as follows: 
(1) when the concentration of a metabolite is below the limit of detection, 
or (2) when values were rejected by the automatic sample and measurement quality control procedure in the Nightingale pipeline. 
All the missing observations were assumed missing at random and treated as parameters.
Values were randomly drawn from a lognormal distribution. 
Regarding the missing values that were below the limit of detection, the imputed values were constrained between zero and the minimal observed value. 
We fitted the model by running Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo in the program Stan (version 2.18.3).
We ran four Markov chains with 2000 iterations in each chain. 
Results were presented with the posterior mean of lognormal regression coefficient with 95% credible interval (CI). 
The lognormal regression coefficient can be interpreted as the expected proportional change in the metabolite concentration.

### Effects of evolocumab on composition of LDL particles

Because Lp(a) is often considered to comprise a LDL particle and covalently bound apo(a), we assumed that a pool of LDL particles is comprised by LDL particles with and without apo(a). 
In the Nightingale platform, three kinds of LDL particles (large, medium and small VLDL) were profiled. 
To identify the proportion of particles with apo(a) in each of these three pools, we ran Bayesian regression analysis. 
The outcome variable ($y$) was concentration of Lp(a). 
Three predictor variables were used: 1) Large LDL particle concentration $x_1$; 2) Medium LDL particle concentration ($x_2$); 3) Small LDL particle concentration ($x_3$). 
We excluded the intercept from our regression model and used the beta distribution $Beta(1,1)$ as the prior distribution for the regression coefficients. 
Because of the same motivation dealing with missing data, we applied the Bayesian approach. 
As mentioned above, we fitted the model by running four Markov chains with 2000 iterations in each chain. 
The regression coefficients are interpreted as proportion of LDL particles with apo(a) tail. 

# Results

The current study included 30 patients (evolocumab, n = 16; placebo, n = 14). 
Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable and provided in Table 1. 

## Effects on lipoprotein particles

Evolocumab treatment for 16 weeks resulted in mean 18.9% (95% credible interval: 7.51% to 29.2%) reduction in Lp(a) compared with placebo (Figure 1).

To identify the corresponding effects of evolocumab on lipoprotein metabolism, we focused on the 14 lipoprotein subclasses. 
We observed that evolocumab treatment resulted in substantial reduction in particle concentration of extremely large (-2.09 [-4.25 -0.284]), very large (-2.87 [-5.53 -0.488]), large (-0.973 [-1.69, -0.350]), medium (-0.702 [-0.979, -0.413]), small (-0.492 [-0.610 -0.367]) and very small VLDL (-0.640 [-0.770 -0.515]) compared with placebo.
We also observed that compared with placebo evolocumab treatment resulted in particle concentration reduction in IDL (-0.765 [-0.930, -0.587]), large (-0.842 [-1.05 -0.657]), medium (-0.901 [-1.12, -0.698]) and small LDL (-0.810 [-1.00, -0.610]). 
In contrast to VLDL and LDL particles, we observed that evolocumab treatment resulted in increasing concentrations of medium HDL particle (0.119 [0.0366, 0.200]) (Figure 2).

## Effects on LDL particle compositions

Lp(a) is thought to be comprised of a LDL particle and a covalently bound apo(a). 
In the Nightingale metabolomics platform, three LDL particles, including large, medium and small LDL, were profiled. 
At baseline, we identified that on average 56% (95% credible interval [9%, 100%]) large LDL, 50% ([3%, 97%]) medium LDL particles and 53% ([7% 99%]) small LDL particles were with apo(a) (Figure 3). 

After treatment of evolocumab, on average 70% (28%, 100%) large LDL particles were with apo(a). 
In the pool of medium LDL particles, on average 61% (11%, 99%) of them were with apo(a). 
Regarding small LDL particles, on average 68% (24%, 100%) of them were with apo(a).

# Discussion

In the current study, evolocumab treatment for 16 weeks resulted in on average 18.9% reduction in Lp(a) compared with placebo.
Our detailed lipoprotein profiling revealed that treatment of evolocumab substantially reduced concentrations of VLDL, IDL and LDL particles. 
Our observation is consistent with the previous study, in which evolocumab treatment not only reduced concentrations of LDL particles, but also substantially reduced triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles [@Toth2018].
The next question we came up with is "why we observed large effect of evolocumab on VLDL, IDL and LDL particle concentrations but relatively small effect on Lp(a)?" 
To address the question, we analyzed the composition of LDL particles. 
Because Lp(a) is often thought to be comprised of a LDL particle and a covalently bound apo(a), we assumed that a pool of LDL particles contained LDL particles with and without apo(a) tail. 
At baseline, we identified that on average about 50% of large, medium and small LDL particles had apo(a) tail. 
Evolocumab treatment not only decreased concentrations of LDL particles, but also resulted in 10-20% increasing in LDL particles with apo(a). 
The composition shifting to relatively more LDL particles with apo(a) indicated that LDL particles with apo(a) were less preferably cleared from the circulation compared to their counterparts without apo(a). 
Indeed Lp(a) needs to compete with LDL particles for binding to the LDL receptor, and is preferred for uptake by the LDL receptor when the LDL particle concentration is low [@Raal2016].  
We hypothesized that the LDL particles with and without apo(a) tail may have different affinity for binding to the LDL receptor. 
Besides LDL receptor, we acknowledge that VLDL receptor can also mediate Lp(a) catabolism [@Argraves1997]. 
In our analysis, we observed substantial reduction in VLDL particle concentrations after treatment of evolocumab. 
Since PCSK9 can induce the degradation of LDL receptor as well as VLDL receptor, evolocumab treatment must enhance activity of both receptors [@Poirier2008]. 
Interestingly, we observed that most of patients receiving evolocumab ended in very low concentration (below the detection limit) of extremely large and very large VLDL particles, suggesting enhancement of VLDL receptor activity. 

## Strengths and limitations

Strengths and limitations of our study warrant consideration. 
Our study provided first insight into relationship between Lp(a) concentrations and NMR LDL particle concentrations. 
One limitation of our study is that due to small sample size, our uncertainty of LDL particle composition estimation is large.
